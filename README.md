**This project is not anymore under active development. The event capture/query may have bugs, and the dashboard is not fully functional. See the new [FasTnT](https://github.com/louisaxel-ambroise/fastnt) project for an active project** 

# FasTnT
FasTnT is a C# implementation of GS1 EPCIS 1.2 standard. [https://www.gs1.org/epcis](https://www.gs1.org/epcis)

## Setup

1. Install PostGreSQL if needed and create a new user/database for FasTnT;
2. Rename the `connectionStrings.default.config` file to `connectionStrings.shared.config` and edit the `FasTnT.Database` connection string with your PostGreSQL DB connection string;
3. Build the solution using `Debug` configuration;
4. Run the `.\tools\Migrations\Up.cmd` script. It will apply the migrations to the database;
5. Set `FasTnT.Web` project as startup project, and start the solution

That's it. You should now have a full EPCIS repository working on your computer.

## Endpoints

### EPCIS endpoints:

- Event capture: `http://localhost:12008/Services/1.2/EpcisCapture/Events` 
- Master Data capture: `http://localhost:12008/Services/1.2/EpcisCapture/Masterdata` 
- Queries : `http://localhost:12008/Services/1.2/EpcisQuery/`

The file `tools\EPCIS_Samples.postman_collection.json` contains sample of HTTP queries that you can perform on FasTnT (import and run in [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/))

The default username/password for the API services is `APIUser`/`ApiP@ssw0rd`.

### Web Dashboard

**FasTnT** also contains an embedded web dashboard that allows you to manage your server, Master Data and allowed users. The default URL is `http://localhost:12008/`.

The default username/password for the dashboard is `Admin`/`p@ssw0rd`.


\* Note that the base URL or port number might change due to your IIS configuration.
